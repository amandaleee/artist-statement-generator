Beginning with a series of startling actions in the early 1970s, Chris Burden challenged his own mental and physical limitations, as well as the boundaries of art and performance. Shut inside a locker for five days (Five Day Locker, 1971); shot in the arm (Shoot, 1971); and nailed through the palms of his hands to the roof of a car (Trans-fixed, 1974), he sought to reflect the violence that defined American politics, society, and media at the time. Burden soon channeled the daring spirit of these early performances into imposing technical feats that similarly explored challenges both individual and social. He used toys (figurines, train sets, Erector parts) as the building blocks for expansive scale models of buildings, dystopic cities, and battlefields, while deploying actual vehicles (ships, trucks, and cars) in surreal and improbable ways.

Buddha's Fingers (2014–15) is a dense cluster of thirty-two antique cast-iron vernacular street lamps, electrified with cool, bright LED bulbs and standing almost twelve feet tall. The work is related to Urban Light (2008), Burden's celebrated permanent installation of 202 lamp posts, which stands at the entrance to LACMA in Los Angeles. In 2000, Burden began collecting the street lamps that used to line residential streets in Los Angeles during the 1920s and 1930s, and repurposed them as sculptural installations. In Buddha’s Fingers, the hexagonal lamp bases are set in a tight honeycomb formation. The whimsical title refers to the fingered citrus fruit “buddha's hand,” a recurrent still-life motif and subject in classical Asian art, and a religious symbol of happiness, longevity, and good fortune.

Chris Burden was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1946, and died in Topanga Canyon, California in 2015. Public collections include Museum of Modern Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; and Tate Modern, London.

In the light of current geopolitical realities and aesthetic debates, Grotjahn's evocation of Captain America may be timely, if not more than a little ironic. Appearing in the early 1940s, the comic-book hero was designed as a patriotic super-soldier who fought the Axis powers of World War II. Aka Steve Rogers, a scrawny artist enhanced to the peak of natural human potential by an experimental serum, Captain America wears a costume that bears a stars-and-stripes motif, a hood emblazoned with an A—America (or Art?)—and is armed with a protective shield against all foes. Although he often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of time with modern realities, after seventy years he remains a beloved national figure, combatting those who espouse ideals contrary to the American Dream, from Nazism to technocratic fascism, and international and domestic terrorism.

In the large-scale, ten-part drawing with its centrifugal radiant motif, Grotjahn synthesizes the comic-book hero into pure, vibrating lines of force in symbolic red, white, and blue. Geometry and process resonate with each other in the razor-sharp perspectival rays and random, all-over marks—traces of Grotjahn's tenacious working method, as he moves from one drawing to another—as well as the skeins of acid-yellow calligraphy that surface from time to time, like an Abstract Expressionist palimpsest.

In America, the impact of twentieth-century capitalism on art promoted an increasing fixation with the sign and the series—Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes and Campbell's Soup Cans, Jasper Johns's targets and flags, Robert Indiana's LOVE sculptures and paintings, to name just a few. With his Sign Exchange project of 1993–98, Grotjahn aligned himself with this astute mixture of readymade and artisanal, and high and low art, replacing the homemade signs of local shopkeepers with his own handpainted copies, and exhibiting the shop originals as his own artwork.

Almost concurrently, he began working on a stream of densely worked colored-pencil drawings with radiant motifs, focusing on perspectival investigations such as dual and multiple vanishing points, techniques used since the Renaissance to create the illusion of depth and volume on a two-dimensional surface. In the Butterfly drawings, the motif appears as a more organic iteration of its perspectival precedent. Anchored to sloping vertical lines, the closely adjacent, triangular motifs achieve a vital dynamism, animated with a kaleidoscopic flutter. These formalist compositions of complex asymmetries and glowing, tonal color allude to the multiple narratives coursing through the history of modernism, from the utopian visions of Russian Constructivism to the hallucinatory images of Op art. The disruptive presence of errant marks and smudges across the surface of each drawing introduces a sense of active contingency into compositions that are otherwise highly controlled.

In addition to the multitudes of individual compositions, Grotjahn has produced several magisterial sequential drawings, consistent with the modernist fascination for serial iteration as free, constructive becoming. The multi-panel pencil drawing, Untitled (Dancing Black Butterflies) (2007), proposes a sort of formal and historical endgame, an enlivened dance of death for the butterfly motif, the normally rainbow-hued "wings" here pared back to Suprematist black. Conversely, Untitled (Captain America), Grotjahn's most monumental drawing series to date, dazzles with the explosive energies of its tricolor motif pulsing across the gallery walls.

The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue with an essay by David Anfam.

A concurrent exhibition of Grotjahn's Sign Exchange project (1993–98) will be presented at Karma, New York from January 9–February 7, 2016.

Mark Grotjahn was born in 1968 in Pasadena, CA. He received an MFA from the University of California, Berkeley, and a BFA from the University of Colorado, Boulder. He lives and works in Los Angeles, CA.

Grotjahn's work is included in museum collections worldwide, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; The Broad, Los Angeles; SFMOMA, San Francisco; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; Des Moines Art Center, Iowa; Cleveland Museum of Art, Ohio; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Tate Modern, London; and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam.

Solo exhibitions include Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2005); Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2006); Kunstmuseum Thun, Switzerland (2007); Portland Art Museum, Oregon (2010); Aspen Museum of Art, Colorado (2012); Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas (2014); and Kunstverein Freiburg, Germany (2014). Major group exhibitions include Whitney Biennial 2006: "Day for Night," New York; the 54th Carnegie International, Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh (2004); "Painting in Tongues," Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2006); "Oranges and Sardines," Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2008); "Collection: MOCA's First Thirty Years," Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, (2009); "The Artist's Museum," Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2010); "The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World," Museum of Modern Art, New York (2014); and "Variations: Conversations in and Around Abstract Painting," LACMA, Los Angeles (2014).


The 12 sculptures and 36 photographs that comprise the new series are at once referential and autonomous. The photographs—large, colorful, and spectacular with a nod to Pop art, and custom-framed in mahogany to emulate the style of boardroom furniture–speak to the bombast of national and corporate symbolism; the sculptures—stylized concrete flower-presses containing delicate preserved floral specimens and their documentation—operate in a discrete and classified zone.

A storyteller whose grist is the instability of fact, Simon’s research-driven approach has produced such impactful bodies of work as The Innocents (2002); An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar (2007); Contraband (2010); and A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters I-XVIII (2008–11); as well as the more whimsical The Picture Collection (2013), and Birds of the West Indies (2013–14). Simon takes empirical photography into the field of post-conceptual practice, with exacting attention to aesthetic and formal concerns.

For the new work, Simon's investigations yielded twin points of departure: George Sinclair's nineteenth century horticultural study (a book containing actual dried grass specimens), which influenced Charles Darwin's theory of evolution; and archival photographs in which flowers feature as silent witnesses in the stagecraft of political and economic power.

In Paperwork and the Will of Capital, Simon examines accords, treaties, and decrees drafted to influence systems of governance and economics, from nuclear armament to oil deals and diamond trading. All involve the countries present at the 1944 United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, which addressed the globalization of economics after World War II, leading to the establishment of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. In images of the signings of these documents, powerful men flank floral arrangements designed to underscore the importance of the parties present. Each of Simon’s recreations of these floral arrangements represents an “impossible bouquet”—a concept that emerged in Dutch still-life painting parallel to the country’s seventeenth-century economic boom, which ushered in the development of modern capitalism. The impossible bouquet, a collection of flowers that could never bloom naturally in the same season and geographic location, is an artificial fantasy made real in Simon’s photographs, thanks to the globalization of the modern flower industry.

For the recreated arrangements, Simon imported more than 4000 flower and plant specimens from the world’s largest flower auction in Aalsmeer, Netherlands, where 20 million flowers arrive and depart daily, bound for international retail destinations. Working with a botanist and from archival records, she identified all the flowers and remade the floral arrangements from each signing, then photographed them against striking bicolored fields relating to the foregrounds and backgrounds in the historical images, pairing each arrangement with a description of the pertinent accord. For the sculptures, selected specimens from the 36 arrangements were dried, pressed, and sewn to archival herbarium paper; a complete set of the 36 botanical collages was then placed in each of the 12 concrete presses, along with inkjet prints of their photographic likenesses and narrative texts--sealed together in a race against time.

Paperwork and the Will of Capital inquires into the instability of executive decision-making and the precarious nature of survival, as well as the reliability and endurance of records: the accords and their far-reaching effects, Simon’s photographs, and the preserved botanical specimens in their concrete presses; language itself. The vivid photographic still lifes stand in contrast to the sculptural natures mortes: as time advances, so may these artifacts transform, revealing mutable versions of themselves.

A fully illustrated catalogue published by Hatje Cantz and Gagosian will include essays by Kate Fowle and Nicholas Kulish, botanical texts by Daniel Atha, and a short story by Hanan al-Shaykh.

Cathedral of the Pines (2013–14) was made during three productions in and around the rural town of Becket, Massachusetts. In images that recall nineteenth-century American and European paintings, Crewdson photographed figures in the surrounding forests, including the actual trail from which the series takes its title. Interior scenes charged with ambiguous narratives probe tensions between art, life, connection and separation, intimacy and isolation.

The series comprises thirty-one digital pigment prints, each measuring 45 × 58 inches framed. In Woman at Sink, a woman pauses from her household upkeep, lost in thought. In Pickup Truck, Crewdson portrays a nude couple in the flatbed of a truck in a dense forest—the woman seated, the man turned away in repose. Crewdson situates his disconsolate subjects in familiar settings, yet their cryptic actions—standing still in the snow, or nude on a riverbank—hint at invisible challenges. Precisely what these challenges are, and what fate awaits these anonymous figures, are left to the viewer's imagination.

For more than twenty years, Crewdson has used the streets and interiors of small-town America as settings for photographic incarnations of the uncanny. Working with a crew, he plans his images as meticulously as any movie director, from the nocturnal Twilight series (1998–2002); to the cerebral Beneath the Roses (2003–08); to Sanctuary (2009). His careful crafting of visual suspense conjures forebears such as Diane Arbus, Alfred Hitchcock, and Edward Hopper. In Cathedral of the Pines, Crewdson's persistent psychological leitmotifs evolve into intimate figurative dramas. 

A fully-illustrated book with an essay by art historian Alexander Nemerov will be released by Aperture in conjunction with the exhibition.

Gregory Crewdson was born in 1962 in Brooklyn, New York, and lives and works in New York City and Massachusetts. Public collections include Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Art Institute of Chicago; Fotomuseum Winterthur; and National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne. Recent solo exhibitions include “Gregory Crewdson: 1985–2005,” Kunstverein Hannover (2005, traveled to Kunstmuseen Krefeld; Fotomuseum Winterthur; and Landesgalerie Linz); “Gregory Crewdson: In a Lonely Place,” C/O Berlin (2011, traveled to Kulturhuset, Stockholm; The Black Diamond, Copenhagen; Stenersen Museum, Oslo; Centre for Contemporary Photography, Melbourne; Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane; City Gallery Wellington; and Dunedin Art Gallery); “Gregory Crewdson: Beneath the Roses,” Museum of Image and Sound, São Paulo (2014); “Gregory Crewdson: Fireflies,” Wave Hill, Bronx, New York (2014); and “Gregory Crewdson: Dream House,” San Diego Museum of Art (2015).

Portraiture was a shared focus of both artists, and they made use of repetition and serialization: Avedon through the reproducible medium of photography, and in his group photographs, for which he meticulously positioned, collaged, and reordered images; Warhol in his method of stacked screenprinting, which enabled the consistent reproduction of an image. Avedon’s distinctive gelatin-silver prints and Warhol's boldly colored silkscreens variously depict many of the same recognizable faces, including Marella Agnelli, Bianca Jagger, Jacqueline Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and Rudolf Nureyev.

Both Avedon and Warhol originated from modest beginnings and had tremendous commercial success working for major magazines in New York, beginning in the 1940s. The 1960s marked artistic turning points for both artists as they moved away increasingly from strictly commercial work towards their mature independent styles. The works in the exhibition, which date from the 1950s through the 1990s, emphasize such common themes as social and political power; the evolving acceptance of cultural differences; the inevitability of mortality; and the glamour and despair of celebrity.

Each gallery will juxtapose works that underscore these themes, beginning with The Family (1976), Avedon's ambitious conceptual portrayal of sixty-nine individuals at the epicenter of American politics at that time, together with Warhol’s monumental portrait of the revolutionary Mao Tse-tung, Mao (1972). In both works, little emotion or expression is revealed in the sitters' faces or postures. Such deadpan was a mark of Pop art ambivalence, more commonly associated with Warhol, but equally applicable in this instance to Avedon.

Both artists sought out individuals who were outside, as well as inside, the mainstream. For Avedon, this resulted in the larger-than-lifesize mural of Andy Warhol and members of The Factory (1969), who represented the heart of New York subculture and incarnated the sexual and cultural revolution. Meanwhile, Warhol memorialized the beauty of drag queens—who he once described as “ambulatory archives of ideal moviestar womanhood”—in his pioneering series of silkscreens, Ladies and Gentlemen (1975).

The third gallery contains an extended meditation on the darker side of human existence, as well as its potential salvation: Warhol’s Skull and Guns paintings are juxtaposed with photographs from Avedon’s Brandenburg Gate portfolio, taken during the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

Finally, celebrity was a topic that was equally explored by both artists: Avedon in his iconic images of Brigitte Bardot (1959) and Audrey Hepburn (1967); and Warhol in his dramatically rendered superstars, such as Double Elvis (1963) and Four Marilyns (Reversal Series) (1986). Driven by their cosmopolitan awareness and mindfulness of the potential for their work to stir change, as well as their diverse cast of modern muses, Avedon and Warhol harnessed the power of images to reflect the revolutionary social attitudes of their time.

A fully illustrated publication accompanying the exhibition will include essays by Michael Bracewell and Ara H. Merjian, as well as a chronology documenting the artists’ careers and points of intersection.

Richard Avedon was born in New York City in 1923 and died while on assignment for The New Yorker in San Antonio, Texas, in 2004. His work is included in the collections of major museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, along with countless other institutions worldwide. Avedon’s first museum retrospective was held at the Smithsonian Institution in 1962. Many major museum exhibitions have followed, including those at the Minneapolis Institute of Fine Arts (1970), Museum of Modern Art (1974), Whitney Museum of American Art (1994), and two at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1978 and 2002). A 2007 retrospective exhibition organized by the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark traveled to Milan, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, and San Francisco. “Richard Avedon: People” was presented at National Portrait Gallery, Canberra in 2013, and traveled to Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth in 2014, and the Ian Potter Museum of Art, Melbourne from 2014–15.

Andy Warhol was born in Pittsburgh in 1928 and died in New York City in 1987. His work is included in public collections worldwide. His first major exhibition was at Ferus Gallery, Los Angeles, in 1962. Since then, his work has been the subject of numerous exhibitions in museums and galleries throughout the world, including retrospectives at Pasadena Art Museum (1970, traveled to Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Stedelijk van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven; Musée d’Art Moderne, Paris; Tate Gallery, London; and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York); Museum of Modern Art, New York (1989, traveled to Art Institute of Chicago; Hayward Gallery, London; Museum Ludwig, Cologne; Palazzo Reale, Milan; and Musée National d’Art Moderne, Paris); and Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin (2001–02, traveled to Tate Modern, London; and Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles). Recent exhibitions include “Warhol: Headlines,” Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna, Rome (2011–12); “Andy Warhol: Shadows,” Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2014–15); “Transmitting Andy Warhol,” Tate Liverpool (2014–15); and “Andy Warhol: Campbell’s Soup Cans and Other Works, 1953–1967,” Museum of Modern Art, New York (2015).

“Fazor” alludes to the “phaser effect”: a musical swirl of oscillating sound that summons the hypno-psychedelic effects informing Korine's latest series of paintings. The large-scale, concentric circles that characterize this series expand upon the line and checker paintings in their embrace of vibrant color combinations. Inspired by sun motifs from the 1960s and 70s, the series conjures the Color-field paintings of Helen Frankenthaler, as well as the color spectrums of Robert Delaunay's Rhythm painting series. A combination of oilstick, acrylic, and house paint is applied to canvas or, in certain cases, reclaimed artworks from Korine's prior abstract series. The rings of each orb resemble the ripple effect, fanning out from a ten-sided star in the middle of each composition. The paintings also reveal improvisational marks, fingerprints, and inadvertent mistakes. Korine riffs on each work impulsively and embraces the physical vigor of repetition and pattern on a grand scale.

The Fazors oblige by the odd bliss of sensory assault; there is no beginning and no end to their effects. Like a tapestry at a headshop, a blazing star from MAD Magazine, or a Bridget Riley optical trance, these paintings thrive on surface tension. In Korine's figurative works, characters disappear and reemerge from a groundless terrain. Lurking ghosts and devilish characters fuse with dizzying loops at hyperspeed. Like Philip Guston's fleshy abstractions, they are animated by his loose touch. Together, the Fazors describe a world that expands and contracts like processed sound—the dream merges with the nightmare to envelop the viewer in the shimmer of the absurd.

Korine's cult films of the past twenty years—from Gummo (1997) to Spring Breakers (2012)—are uncanny insights into modern life. Their narratives confuse reality and fiction by way of partially scripted stories, montage, hand-held camerawork, and attention to the grotesque. Korine's films are experiments in suspended disbelief that cite narratives intimately related to his own biography with a sardonic twist. Improvised sequences and unplanned “mistakes” leave breadcrumbs of truth to lead viewers through a maddening reality. The films seek out “perfect nonsense,” as Korine mentioned in an interview in The Believer, “an emotional sense, rather than any kind of laid out logic or standard set of rules.”

Korine will be speaking at The British Film Institute Southbank on Wednesday, February 10, at 8:50pm in conjunction with the exhibition. Tickets can be purchased at whatson.bfi.org.uk.

Harmony Korine was born in Bolinas, California in 1973. He lives and works in Nashville, Tennessee. He has written and directed films including Gummo (1997), Julien Donkey-Boy (1999), Trash Humpers (2009), and Spring Breakers (2012). He has also collaborated extensively with director and photographer Larry Clark on films including Kids (1995) and Ken Park (2002, with Ed Lachman); and with Avi Korine on Mister Lonely (2007). Korine has generated photographs, text, drawings, paintings, and music in unconventional forms since 1998. Korine published his first novel, A Crack Up at the Race Riots, in 1998. Solo exhibitions of his films, photographs, and paintings include “Harmony Korine: Pigxote,” Vanderbilt University Fine Arts Gallery, Nashville (2009); and “Harmony Korine,” S.M.A.K, Ghent (2000). His work was included in the 50th Biennale di Venezia (2003); and the Whitney Biennial, Whitney Museum of American Art (2000).

For Oehlen, the practice of painting and its inherent unpredictability is a subject in itself. The guiding principles of his method are impulse and eclecticism, while his tools are fingers, brushes, collage, and computer. He often begins by imposing a set of rules or structural limitations—restricting his palette or deliberately working at a slow pace—while challenging himself to approach each painting differently. He treats abstraction as either gesture or geometry, superimposed, in combination, or conflated with a figurative register, as in readymade posters covered in smudges and stains. Pictorial form is a trigger rather than an end in itself.

In a group of aluminum-panel paintings rendered in a simple, striking palette in various combinations of red, black, blue and white, Oehlen creates tree-like forms as vehicles for a methodical deflation of content. Like Piet Mondrian and Georg Baselitz before him, the tree has been a recurring motif for Oehlen since the 1980s: in paintings such as Untitled (1989), the isolated, literally described trees undermine the common role of identifiable images through “bad” painting. In the new schematic forms—rendered in non-naturalistic contrasts of vivid red, black, white, and blue—trunks and branches become pure silhouettes that suggest the digital marks of art and design software, even though they have been meticulously hand-painted in oil paint. Flattening and overlapping surface, color, and content through cut-and-paste revisions of a fundamental biological form, Oehlen calls into question both nature versus the most essential tools of painting.

A forthcoming fully illustrated catalogue with an essay by Ann Goldstein will be published to accompany the exhibition. An artist talk between Albert Oehlen and Glenn Brown will take place on February 5, 2016 at Grosvenor Hill.

Albert Oehlen was born in 1954 in Krefeld, Germany and studied at Hochschule für Bildende Künste, Hamburg. From 2000-09 he was a professor of painting at Kunstakademie Düsseldorf.

Richard Serra was born in San Francisco in 1938 and has lived in New York since 1966. He studied at the University of California (Berkeley and Santa Barbara) and at Yale University. Serra was awarded the insignia of Chevalier de la légion d'honneur by the French government in June 2015.

Recent exhibitions include "Richard Serra Sculpture: Forty Years," Museum of Modern Art, New York (2007); "Richard Serra: Promenade," Monumenta, Grand Palais, Paris (2008); "Richard Serra Drawings—Work Comes Out of Work," Kunsthaus Bregenz (2008); and "Richard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective," Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2011, traveled to San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and the organizing venue, Menil Collection, Houston).

In 2005, The Matter of Time (1994–2005), a series of eight monumental sculptures, was installed at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. East-West/West-East (2014) was permanently installed in the desert of the Brouq Nature Reserve in western Qatar in 2014.

Since 1983, Gagosian has presented more than twenty-five major exhibitions of Serra's work in the U.S. and Europe, including "Intersection II" (Gagosian New York, 1993); "Switch," which inaugurated Gagosian West 24th Street, New York in 1999; "Wake Blindspot Catwalk Vice-Versa" (Gagosian New York, 2003); "Junction/Cycle" (Gagosian New York, 2011); "Drawings" (Gagosian Paris, 2011–12); "Double Rifts" (Gagosian Beverly Hills, 2013); "New Sculpture" (Gagosian New York, 2013–14); the concurrent exhibitions "Backdoor Pipeline, Ramble, Dead Load, London Cross" and "Drawing" (Gagosian London, 2014–15); and "Ramble Drawings" (Gagosian New York, 2015). In spring of 2016, Gagosian New York will present new large-scale sculptures at the 21st and 24th Street galleries.

Cultivating an eclectic formalism across mediums, Ruby creates vivid poured-polyurethane sculptures, drawings, collages, richly glazed ceramics, spray paintings, and videos. Oscillating between solid and liquid, minimalist and expressionist, pristine and abject, he alludes to rituals both mainstream and marginal, autobiography, and art history. Intellectually, frontiers interest him, from urban gang territories demarcated in graffiti to the charting of newly discovered stars and planets; in his work, Ruby tests formal limits, marking the edges of the canvas and limning the boundaries between creation, destruction, and renewal. In abstract paintings, acts of defacement evolve into a painterly sublime; while wood-burning stoves, ceramic basins containing shards of broken or misfired pottery, and soft sculptures resembling fanged jaws convey the raw potential of sculpture.

In the new YARD paintings at Gagosian Rue de Ponthieu, Ruby uses rollers and brooms to spread a soft palette of red, blue, green, and purple acrylic paints over unprimed canvases laid directly on the studio ground; incidental debris and textures beneath the canvas emerge as impressions during the frottage process. Fabric, cardboard, and other studio fragments are attached to the edges of each painting, like mysterious satellites at the borders of indeterminate topographies. Titles such as TCOM KUWAIT and DURAND LINE reference aerial military surveillance and conflict areas; others—ALPHA ANDROMEDAE, TIAMAT, PANGEA ULTIMA—are borrowed from constellations, ancient mythologies, and a potential supercontinent of the distant future.

At the Gagosian Le Bourget gallery are new sculptures made from hulking industrial parts sourced in the vicinity of Ruby’s Los Angeles studio. In these melancholic hybrids, Ruby combines huge fragments of a reclaimed American submarine with engine parts and steel pipes to create freestanding, battleship-gray abstractions that resemble drag cars, bulldozers, and plows. Titles such as HULL (VIPER) and DRAG (BANKER) hint at these transformations. These sculptures are interspersed with grounded soft sculptures entitled CANDLES: brightly colored, stuffed textiles manipulated to resemble overturned lit candlesticks. DEEP FLAGS are vast synthetic black fleeces stained with bleach; a rectangular fragment of the same material is attached to the upper left corner of each work, echoing the stars of the American flag. The speckled panels also evoke the fathomless depth of outer space, a sensation that ends abruptly at their striped elastic borders. Parsing the boundaries that divide, protect, isolate, and promote individual cultures, Ruby continues to evolve his dissonant formal reflection of contemporary reality.

The exhibitions are accompanied by a fully illustrated publication with an essay by critic and novelist Philippe Dagen.

Concurrent to these exhibitions the Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature will present Ruby’s monumental woodburning STOVES, installed in the central courtyard of the museum. A fully illustrated book documenting the production of the works will be published on the occasion.

Lindbergh’s now-iconic photographs of women derive inspiration from early narrative cinema and street photography, in their fleeting observations and compositional elegance. His Eastern European heritage can be traced in the stark and guileless realism that frames the feminine beauty of his subjects.

In his editorial work for Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Interview, and many other international magazines, Lindbergh replaces staged, calculated glamour with a vérité approach, enhanced by his use of high-contrast black-and-white photography. He uses body movement, in particular modern dance, to celebrate the human form in a way that carries elements of both antiquity and modernity.

Spanning the last thirty years, the exhibition testifies to Lindbergh’s impact on the world of fashion photography, and his contribution to portraiture in general. The beauty of his female subjects is purposeful, self-possessed, and uninhibited. With little styling or setting to divert attention, Lindbergh’s approach emphasizes the raw physical grace of his subjects.

In a diptych of Monica Bellucci, one image holds her untamed and purposeful stare as she walks toward the camera, while in the other she looks away, apparently absorbed in a private moment far from the camera’s eye. In an homage to the late choreographer Pina Bausch, five models merge in an interlocking movement, their limbs and curves becoming elements of pure abstraction. In another photograph, Karen Elson’s pale stillness recalls classical stone statuary.

Drawing has always been central to Baselitz's art. Parallel to his cerebral yet impassioned paintings and roughly hewn sculptures, the practice of drawing is a test-site for assimilation and disorientation in his oeuvre. In a new series of two-part ink drawings, Baselitz is "visited" by Katsushika Hokusai (1760–1849), whose exquisitely controlled color-woodblock prints epitomized the refined ukiyo-e genre in Japanese art and persist in the popular imagination today.

In each diptych, Baselitz pairs reconsidered motifs from his own work with iterations—in ink with blue, yellow or green watercolor washes—of an intimate late work by Hokusai, a wry self-portrait sketched at the end of a letter to his print publisher in 1842. The letter accompanied a group of prints made forty years earlier, which the Japanese master described to his publisher as repetitive, unresolved, and immature. He signed it with his pseudonym of the day: "Sincerely yours, the eighty-three year old Hachiemon."

The message of Hokusai's letter is that perfection comes with age and hindsight. Paired with his confidently drawn self-portrait as a mischievous old man, this poignant gesture from the elderly artist evidently provides inspiration across time and culture for Baselitz's own pursuit of newness and transformation while continuing to reflect on his own life and mortality.

The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated publication with an essay by John-Paul Stonard.

Penck, Sigmar Polke, and Gerhard Richter.

In an oeuvre spanning more than forty years, Penone has explored the subtle levels of interplay between man, nature, and art. His work represents a poetic expansion of Arte Povera's radical break with conventional media, emphasizing the involuntary processes of respiration, growth, and aging that are common to both human being and tree.

In December 1968 Penone performed a series of formative acts, literally described, in a forest near his home in Garessio, Italy. In one, he interlaced the stems of three saplings in Ho intrecciato tre alberi/I have interwoven three trees; in another, Albero/filo di zinco/rame/Tree/wire of zinc/copper, he made the imprint of his hand in nails on the trunk of a tree and then affixed twenty-two pieces of lead (his age at the time), joined up with zinc and copper wire. In Crescendo innalzerà la rete/Growing it will raise the net he enclosed the top of a tree in a net weighed down with plants; while in L'albero ricorderà il contatto/The tree will remember the contact, he pressed his body to a tree, marking the points of contact with the trunk in barbed wire. In Continuerà a crescere tranne che in quel punto/It will continue to grow except at that point he intervened in the growth processes of a tree by inserting a steel cast of his own hand; over time the tree retained the memory of his gesture. In a stream he immersed a slab of cement of the dimensions of his body with the imprints of his hands, feet and face (La mia altezza, la lunghezza delle mie braccia, il mio spessore in un ruscello/My height, the length of my arms, my girth in a stream).

In the early 1970s, Penone continued to work with his own body by transcribing the textures of his skin and casting his face in plaster. For Turning One's Eyes Inside Out (1970), he was photographed wearing mirrored contact lenses, positing vision as the precise point of separation between self and environment. "The work of the poet," he wrote, "is to reflect like a mirror the visions that his sensibility has given him, to produce the sights, the images necessary to collective imaginings."

Engaging with, and subtly intervening in nature so as to reimagine it in artificial terms, Penone finds ever new ways to mark the persistence of biological life, harmonizing elemental occurrences in terms of his own artistic drive. In each work, he reveals the innate sculptural qualities of natural materials, chiseling marble and casting from nature to expose the deep patterns of growth and time.

In the current exhibition, Riflesso del bronzo/Reflection of bronze (2004) is a wall-mounted work in eight parts, where each dimly reflective, excoriated bronze plaque, successively cast from its immediate predecessor, is, literally, a mirror to time and process. The connection between act and contact, trace and imprint is further explored in Spine d'acacia—Contatto, aprile 2006/Acacia thorns—Contact, April 2006, where Penone painstakingly attached thousands of sharp thorns onto paneled canvas in sweeping whorls. At the center of the composition emerges the impression of a huge pair of lips, as if pressed directly on the canvas in visceral relation with nature.

The tree and its relationship to man is among Penone's most enduring subjects and a seemingly inexhaustible source of inspiration. A series of works Indistinti confini/Indistinct boundaries (2012), with their individual subtitles citing ancient Italian rivers, are bare tree trunks on pedestals, carved with astonishing veracity in ghostly white marble, into which Penone has embedded rusting iron nails and bronze knots. These metal elements eventually leach into and stain the marble, so the work appears to be, in a sense, "alive." Foglie di pietra/Leaves of stone (2013), from which the exhibition takes its title, is a series of sculptures in which tall splints of delicate cast bronze tree branches cradle found fragments of eighteenth-century ornamental stonework inspired by vegetal forms, a meditation on the endurance of nature beyond the passage of manmade culture and history.

Gravity and Growth, a major outdoor commission for the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, was completed in 2015 and he is currently working on a permanent commission for the Louvre Abu Dhabi in UAE. An exhibition of his work is planned at the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam in 2016.
